Create Buzzfeed-style quizzes and share results on social media.

== Description ==

Allows you to create multiple-choice question quizzes, like those on the Buzzfeed website. 

Allows you to create as many questions as you wish, each with as many picture outcomes as you wish. Each of the picture 
outcomes may or may not be associated with a particular result. Place the quiz in a post or page by pasting in its shortcode.
